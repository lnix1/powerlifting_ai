# Welcome!

You've found the respository for a personal passion of mine to experiment with build AI tools for powerlifting.
This work is an introduction and learning experience as I dive into the world of computer vision. 
My goal here is to develop a tool for pose estimation specifically trained to a powerlifting use-case for checking the depth of a lifter's squat motion.
Ideally, this tool will primarily be used in a training scenario to check depth in a consistent way prior to a lifter's competition. 
In this way, the lifter can ensure they are regularly reaching depth rather than judging by feeling, only to then get two red lights for depth the day of their comp.

## A Guide to what you see here

### PROJECT_PLAN.md

- The Project Plan serves as a record of my research and project planning. It is a living document and a checklist of my progress.

### INSTRUCTIONS.md

- The Instructions file serves to record hardware used, software requirements, and a record steps needed to run and use each module I develop for this project.
- The primary modules include:
	1. A tool for annotating video files
	2. A tool for specifying and training a model
	3. A tool for packaging and deploying a model to the AI camera
	4. An application for running the camera, model, and judging lifter depth in real-time.
